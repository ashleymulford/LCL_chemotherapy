## Rome Semester work

# To Do List:
## Go through other populations and figure out what data is available, work towards expanding scope of project beyond YRI
  CEU - Central European, Utah USA
  YRI - Yoruba, Nigeria
  JPT - Japanese, Tokyo Japan
  ASW - African American, SW USA
  CHB - Han Chinese, Bejing China
  CHD - Han Chinese, Denver USA
## Analyze YRI results from gwas and predixcan
## Write up abstract, background, and proposal including objectives, methods, and budget.
## Sumbit grant and grad school applications


# Set up instructions:
## log into global protect
## mount with sftp net
## open R and set working directory
## terminal through putty as usually


# Population makeup: 
## analyze with R
  # Restock environment:
  ## pheno <- read.table(file = "master_cytotoxicity_info_130311_plus_igrowth.txt", header = TRUE)
  ## pheno_YRI <- subset(pheno, pop == "YRI")
  ## pheno_CHB <- subset(pheno, pop == "CHB")
  ## pheno_CHD <- subset(pheno, pop == "CHD")
  ## pheno_ASW <- subset(pheno, pop == "ASW")
  ## pheno_CEU <- subset(pheno, pop == "CEU")
  ## pheno_JPT <- subset(pheno, pop == "JPT")
  # Go through which pops have data for which drugs
## compile in google sheets
  
#Catch up other pops
#For asn: both pheno and fam had extra individuals, used inner_join to keep only those which appear in both.

ASN_pheno_ordered <- inner_join(fam, asn, by = c("FID" = "FID", "IID" = "IID", "FatID" = "father", "MatID" = "mother", "Sex" = "sex"))

##make relationship matrices


# Run predixcan V7
